The Environmental Protection Agency describes six common air pollutants as "criteria pollutants." These criteria pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide. The EPA sets standards and regulations for these pollutants under the Clean Air Act.

The EPA's AirData database provides information that the agency has collected on the presence of criteria pollutants at monitoring sites. This data has been incorporated into this map to visualize where criteria pollutants have been found in the United States, and to what extent.

The first dropdown menu in the top right can be used to see polygonal data by county or point data by individual monitoring site. The second filters the data by criteria pollutant. For both maps, colors darken where air pollution is more prevalent. For the point map, the points also increase in size.

By hovering over a county or point, a popup appears to name the location and specify the exact value of pollution discovered.
